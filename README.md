# Hangman

At University of California, Riverside, I took CS/EE 120B Introduction to Embedded Systems in Spring 2025. For my final project, I created the game hangman on an Elegoo UNO R3 kit. I enjoyed seeing the intersection between software and hardware by coding a video game that I can physically play with buttons and screens external to my computer. Learning electrical engineering concepts made me a better programmer. 

This project had no Arduino libraries and is built using bare AVR and a concurent synchSM. Some AVR libraries were provided by my instructor Philip Brisk, and modified for my own needs. 

This project was 3-weeks long and features the use of a passive buzzer with custom music, an LCD screen with custom characters, and an IR remote. I received full credit; however, with more time I would improve this project by allowing 6 penalties to create a full stick man character. I would also add a check to prevent the user from guessing a duplicate letter as well as displaying the letters they have guessed. Adding an error checking mechanism to ensure gibberish is not inputted is something else I would add. 

However, with my limited time and with taking other courses, I am proud to have created a working hangman game. For more information, click the report below.
